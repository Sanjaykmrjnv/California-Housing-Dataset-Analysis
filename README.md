# California-Housing-Dataset-Analysis
 This project aims to explore the California Housing Dataset and answer 10 mandatory questions related to the dataset. The dataset consists of information about the housing details of various districts in California, and includes 10 attributes, including the target attribute 'median_house_value'.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following packages installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these packages using pip by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Files

- **california_housing.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the analysis of the California Housing Dataset.
- **housing.xlsx**: The original dataset in XLSX format.
- **requirements.txt**: A file containing a list of all the required Python packages and their versions used in the project.

## Questions

**The following 10 mandatory questions are answered in this project:**

1. What is the average median income of the dataset, and what is the distribution of the data using appropriate plots?
2. What is the distribution of housing_median_age, and what observations can be made?
3. How are median_income and median_house_values related, and how can this be visualized?
4. How can a new dataset be created by deleting the corresponding examples from the original dataset for which total_bedrooms are not available?
5. How can a new dataset be created by filling the missing data with the mean value of the total_bedrooms in the original dataset?
6. How can a user-defined function be created to calculate the median value of the dataset wherever required?
7. How can latitude versus longitude be plotted, and what observations can be made?
8. How can a new dataset be created for which the ocean_proximity is 'Near ocean'?
9. What is the mean and median of the median_income for the dataset created in question 8?
10. How can a new column named 'total_bedroom_size' be added, and what values should be assigned based on the total number of bedrooms?
